## Khwish-backend
This is a Spring Boot based backend server application written in Java 8.
This is the backend for the Khwish platform, which handles the following tasks:
- User login & signup via Google, Facebook, and Phone Number using Firebase & Facebook integration 
- User onboarding and User authentication
- Goals & Events CRUD operations
- Gifting/Contribution website data handling
- Instamojo Payment integration
- Accounting for contributions to goals.
- User wallet balance, wallet activities & withdrawal. (Actual money transfer for withdrawal is manual)
- Notifications via email using Sendgrid, Slack webhook messaging & updates in Google Sheets.
- PostgreSQL database integration

Please feel free to check out the codebase and let me know if you have any suggestions/improvements.

This was a part of the Khwish project, which I created in early 2020. Please read about it [here](https://gist.github.com/2sjha/b9012f396290bf3b8ebfc2b89fcd01c4). Khwish platform was discontinued around mid-late 2020; I'm no longer actively working on this project.
